"""KERAS Stochastic gradient descent optimizer.

Includes support for momentum,
learning rate decay, and Nesterov momentum.

# Arguments
    lr: float >= 0. Learning rate.
    momentum: float >= 0. Parameter that accelerates SGD
        in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations.
    decay: float >= 0. Learning rate decay over each update.
    nesterov: boolean. Whether to apply Nesterov momentum.
